<p>This Sunday the 24th of July we will be paying our native plant area and fledgling arboretum an overdue visit. If you are interested in native plants, learning the benefits of sheet mulching, wanting to learn how to install a simple irrigation system or simply ready to spend a day with people on the farm it&#39;s a great day to come out. We will start at 10 with clearing around plants, followed by sheet mulching, and finish the day with planting and servicing the irrigation system. All who come to share can join us for lunch.</p>
