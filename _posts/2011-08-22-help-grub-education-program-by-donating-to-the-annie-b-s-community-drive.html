<p>What is Annie B’s Community Drive?</p>

<p>The North Valley Community Foundation has launched the largest community-wide
grant program in the region—Annie B’s Community Drive. All nonprofit
organizations and charitable causes in Butte, Glenn, Tehama and Colusa
counties are eligible to participate in a two month fundraising drive.
North Valley Community Foundation will give a percentage grant for
monies raised.</p>

<p>One hundred percent of the monies raised for GRUB through Annie B’s
Community Drive will go to improving the quality of our lives and all
life we interact with through locally based, chemical free
agriculture, sharing of resources, and experiential learning and
services. Our current programs include school and community gardens,
support in zero waste events, workshops that better connect us to our
community, and support for other innovated ideas. After September 30,
NVCF will tally the total amount raised by all participating
nonprofits and determine the percentage grant amounts that will be
added to the funds we raise.</p>

<p>Donations must be received by NVCF between August 1 and September 30.
The donation deadline is September 30 at 5pm.  Donations can be
accepted in many forms. Checks are most commonly used, but donations
can also be made online with your credit card. NVCF also accepts gift
of stocks or equities, and can even accept gifts of real estate or
other personal property of value.</p>
