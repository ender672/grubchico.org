<p>FIELD TRIP with &quot;Davids organic gardening class&quot;:http://valleyoaktool.com/ to our farm.</p>

<p>This is a great opportunity to see what GRUB is growing, and to ask questions. We will have a lot to say about planting Alliums, including onions &amp; garlic. We will visit our greenhouse and get ideas for what you can plant at this time of year. The cover crops are up, and we can learn about that too. We have pigs and chickens and sheep to see as well.</p>

<p>Cost: $10 per person. Pay at the event. No need to register in advance.</p>
