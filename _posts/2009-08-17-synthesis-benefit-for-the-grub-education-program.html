<p>Synthesis Art Show Benefit. Thank you!
The Synthesis organized and hosted an art show on Saturday and the proceeds were kindly donated to the GRUB education program. We are very grateful for the bands, artists and volunteers who contributed. It was a rockin party at the Synthesis office. The whole GRUB house attended and we had a blast. Hats off to all involved, including:</p>
