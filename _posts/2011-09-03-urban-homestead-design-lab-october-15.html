<p>2pm to 5pm at the GRUB Cooperative, 1525 Dayton Rd.</p>

<p>Eager to start homesteading in your urban or suburban lot? Wondering how to fit anything into the small space you have? How to begin? This workshop is an opportunity to learn about the different elements that make up an urban homestead and how to put them together in whatever space you have. Ask questions about the limitations and opportunities of both your land and your lifestyle, and start putting ...the design elements together. This workshop will offer some basics in permaculture design, as well as some common sense how-to projects for the urban homestead. This workshop is experiential--come with your questions and ideas and expect to experiment with a variety of homesteading options.</p>

<p>Taught by Rachel Kaplan, an urban homesteader, backyard gardener, and co-author of the recently published Urban Homesteading: Heirloom Skills for Sustainable Living.</p>
