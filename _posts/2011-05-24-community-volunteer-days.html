<p>This is Max from GRUB letting you know that I am going to be hosting community volunteer days every other Sunday on the farm at 1525 Dayton Rd. The first will be this coming Sunday the 29th of May. We will work on fencing in the orchard for future feathered inhabitants (chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys), and planting a crop of dry beans (also in the orchard). Our fencing technique makes use of all salvaged materials and can easily be replicated for free by anyone who is interested in creating their own fencing, oh and by the way I think it is beautiful. Volunteer work days will begin at 10am and end at 3pm. All who join will be fed a hearty seasonal lunch with food from the farm.</p>

<p>The intention is to provide an opportunity for the greater community to spend time on the farm in a productive environment. Its a chance to share with each other, nurture friendships, and get a feel for small scaled agriculture and community living. Projects will range from building fences, to greenhouses, to care of perennial and native plants, as well as annual row crops. We will build solar dehydrators, and learn various methods of food preservation amongst many other projects that are yet to come to mind.</p>

<p>Those of us leading projects will do our best to make volunteer days as educational as possible. I hope that this time can be a time of thought provoking conversations, and of exploring different methods of meeting our needs as individuals. We will do our best to demonstrate low to no-cost methods of achieving our goals, this way I hope anyone who wants will be able to replicate/adapt these methods on their own.</p>

<p>The week before each work day I will write up a description of the upcoming projects and send out an e-mail to our list serve, this will also be posted on the calendar of our website.</p>
