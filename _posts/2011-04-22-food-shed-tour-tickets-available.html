<p>Butte County is lucky to have so much good food grown and produced in this area. During a series of 2 hour tours of 5 farms in our local foodshed, you will grow a greater understanding from where your food comes and why these farmers and producers work so hard to bring it to our tables.  The series will conclude at the GRUB farm with a picnic after the tour that  members will create with the delicious foods from the farms we visited. <a href="http://grubchico.org/food_shed_tour">Register Here</a></p>
