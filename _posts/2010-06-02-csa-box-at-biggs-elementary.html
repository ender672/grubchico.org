<p>We got an email from the 5th grade class at Biggs Elementary:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my CSA Box! It was so exciting! One of my students thought that we got a pineapple based on the leek tops sticking out of the top of the box. This started a conversation of where pineapple was grown and the map came down.
Next, we examined all the food and decided to make a salad (kids were excited to find flowers in the salad mix) and a sir fry. We washed and chopped the salad, adding green onions and a bit of all the herbs (love those!).
We shucked and salt water blanched the favas (we are growing those in our school garden too) and then removed the seed coat and added them to our stir fry of garlic scapes, red onion, kale, cabbage, and green herbs. (Thanks for the info sheet about what is happening on your farm and the explanation of the scapes. I also like the idea of cooking rice and lentils together and will need to keep those in the classroom, since I do have a rice cooker)
We made a quick oil and vinegar dressing for the salad, picked a few Chinese pea pods from our garden and feasted! Kids seemed to like the cooked greens the most and many came back for seconds. I got a few pictures that I will forward when I have a chance. Thanks again for this fantastic gift of farm fresh food, straight from the dirt!
