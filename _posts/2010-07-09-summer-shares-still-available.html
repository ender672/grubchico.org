<p>Summer shares are still available from the CSA farm. Each week we offer a share of the wide variety of delicious fresh picked vegetables. You get to come out to the farm, walk around the fields, check out our wonderful animals and chat with your farmers. Shares cost $75 per month. Call Lee at 680-4543 for more info.</p>
