<p>Here at GRUB when we have large loads we want to move by bike we use one of our two bike carts. They were both custom built here in Chico by our friend Greg.  You can learn more about his work at <a href="http://www.bigkidbike.com">bigkidbike.com</a>. He does custom design and is working on creating a locking cart right now. You can contact him through his website.</p>
