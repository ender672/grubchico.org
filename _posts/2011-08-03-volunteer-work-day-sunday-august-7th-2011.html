title: Volunteer Work Day, Sunday August 7th, 2011

<p>Here&#39;s the scoop for our next volunteer work day on August 7th from 10am to 3pm. We are going to help the CSA take care of their shade
needs for protecting the produce coming out of the field before being
moved under the shelter of our friend the Walnut tree. We have been
collecting urbanite (chunks of sidewalk mostly), clay (from work sites
in the hills), horse manure (from a neighbor) and some sand. All the
ingredients for a nice day of cob sculpting. Friday the 12th of August
we will be spending the afternoon setting up the foundation of the
structure digging post holes for the wood frame of the structure to
support wooden side walls and a corrugated metal roof, as well as the
urbanite base to cover with cob the following Sunday.</p>

<p>There will be plenty to do on both days so please feel free to join us
for either or both. We are hoping to not only make this a functional
shade structure, but also a nice cool spot to take a break from the
summer heat, and the winter rain. There will be a variety of tasks to
be undertaken from doing the barefoot cob mixin&#39; dance, to sculpting,
to installing the wood walls, the metal roof, and of course decorating
the cob as the final layer goes on. This is a kid friendly project and
lunch will be served for all who come to share in the fun.</p>

<p>Materials we can use for this project include;</p>

<ul>
<li>urbanite</li>
<li>clay</li>
<li>mosaic decorations</li>
<li>corrugated sheet metal roofing</li>
<li>sand</li>
<li>horse manure</li>
</ul>

<p>We have enough materials to get going, but could use help if anyone
has or knows about any of these so as to make sure we have enough to
finish the project and leave room for our future cob building ideas.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time and I hope to see you on the farm.</p>
