        <h2>Market Every Wednesday</h2>
        <p>From 4pm to 7pm at 1525 Dayton Rd.</p>
        <p>
          We invite you to visit the farm and purchase fresh produce and other
          items. Other CSA's have farm pick-up so we've gone a step further and
          set up a market place every Wednesday.

        <h3>Practices</h3>
        <p>
          We are growing an abundance of fruits and vegetables, and we are doing
          it while improving the soil on our farm.
          Most of our row crops are grown on raised beds, and after we finish
          harvesting a crop, we simply add more compost on top of the bed and
          plant again.
