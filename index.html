      <h2>The GRUB Education Nonprofit</h2>
      <p>
        This program is an exploration into the health of a local
        interdependence where stewardship of the land, the environment, and the
        community is the primary purpose. Our society is an accumulation of the
        stories of its living community, a fabric woven by threads of
        commonality. We at GRUB have decided to take responsibility for our
        experience. We have chosen to change our patterns in a fabric we are a
        part of creating. We are living a life that finds balance through
        diversity; we have chosen to switch threads.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are a federally-recognized 501(c)(3) tax-exempt nonprofit
        organization (EIN# 31-1776669) and are registered as a charitable
        organization with the State of California.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our community garden program is in part contracted by Cultivating
        Community North Valley. Through this USDA grant we are able to help
        create new gardens that will support low-income areas. We offer support
        in finding a garden to work in, technical support with set-up,
        maintenance questions, and workshops to expand ones garden skills. You
        can find out more at culitivingcommunitynv.org.
