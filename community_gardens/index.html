GRUB Supported Community Gardens place people into power to take on their own learning; setting them up with an environment which becomes the teacher itself, both literally and figuratively.
  </p>

  <p>
Each garden has sprung from a vision shared by one or more people of learning the art of gardening that produces food for the table while nourishing our desire for developing lasting friendships. These gardens may exist on private land by permission of owner, at a housing shelter for the homeless, or even on an abandoned tennis court located behind an established apt complex.

    <h3><a href="#what">What is a GRUB Supported Community Garden?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
A GRUB supported community garden is a parcel of land containing one single garden that is shared by all. Each person working in the garden shares the day's harvest. Excess food is delivered to shelters, food pantries and those unable to get fresh produce locally.
      </p>
      <p>
The goal of the Community Garden project is to establish a sustainable food network in Chico. We are achieving this by creating a network of neighborhood gardens that are founded, worked, harvested, and supported by our community.
      </p>
      <p>
All gardens use sound principles of Organic gardening starting with composting to feed the soil. Fertilizers come from organic sources. We have found that virtually anything can be successfully grown without the use of pesticides or herbicides.
      </p>
      <p>
It's an interactive way of getting things done, based on shared learning, a convergence of goals and concerted action ... to "advocate an interactive or participatory style of problem solving whereby outside intervention takes the form of facilitation," in Wheelbarrows full of frogs: Social Learning in Rural Resource Management (Leeuwis &amp; Pyburn, 2002).
      </p>

    <h3><a href="#role">What does GRUB bring to the gardens?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
We all bring our unique experiences to the table and to the garden - with humble beginnings. None of us had experience farming before starting GRUB.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
    The intention for each community garden is to be sustainable, thus standing on its own; managed and maintained by its community members and volunteers.
        </li>
        <li>
    GRUB individuals act as a bridge that facilitates the needs of a group ready to care for or expand a garden; we are a resource to be utilized by our community. 
        </li>
      </ul>
</div>
    <h3><a href="#how">How does GRUB Support the Gardens?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
We offer the initial impetus to get the ball rolling. Re-using salvaged and donated materials as well as working within a budget based upon available funding, we work in conjunction with the needs of the community and the nature of the space. Funding for the materials and labor is sporadic through the form of grants, fund-raisers, and community supported donations with a strong focus on volunteering.
      </p>
      <p>
Support through initial coordination and collective action. Construction, Installation and Consultation.
      </p>

</div>
    <h3><a href="#community">How is the Community Involved?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
Secure garden locations are donated by people in our community for people within our community. It is not necessary to know how to garden; you do not have to be an expert or have experience. You just have to be willing to try.
      </p>
      <p>
No one demographic is targeted. The more diverse we are the better; just like our gardens. The community gardens are non-exclusive. We want to increase access to and tenure of the land, and to encourage and welcome diversity in order to share our environmental and place based knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
Learning in practice and learning from practice. Problem solving, mentoring, inspiring and networking.
