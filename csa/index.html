  <p>
    Sustainably Farming in Chico since 2007, the <b>GRUB CSA Farm</b> is a diversified
    vegetable farm growing forty-five crops in more than 180 distinct varieties
    to feed Chico's longest running CSA. While we specialize in growing heirloom
    tomatoes, summer lettuce, gourmet potatoes, and heirloom dry beans, the
    strength of a CSA lies in the diversity of its crops. It is the great
    diversity of crops that we grow combined with responsible land stewardship
    that allows us to be confident in our ability to provide our members with an
    abundance of produce each week throughout the growing season. Compost, cover
    crops, and crop rotations, along with OMRI listed soil amendments help us
    give back to the soil that gives us so much. No chemically synthesized or
    petroleum based fertilizers, fungicides, or pesticides are ever used on our
    farm. At the <b>GRUB CSA Farm</b> we are dedicated to <b>sustainable farming
    practices</b>, and take our responsibilities as stewards of the land seriously.
    Everything in your weekly CSA share is grown by us truly, and is as local as
    the trip from your house to ours.

    <h3><a href="#what">What is CSA?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        <b>C</b>ommunity <b>S</b>upported <b>A</b>griculture (CSA) is a relationship between a farm and
        the people it nourishes as well as a partnership between the CSA members and
        their farmers. The people, referred to as <b><i>members</i></b>, invest in the farm for
        the season and in return they receive a weekly <b><i>share</i></b> of what the farm
        produces throughout the season. This direct relationship prevents any third
        parties from profiting from the exchange, often resulting in a better value
        for the members, and a better return for the farmers. Joining a CSA is a
        great way to demonstrate your commitment to supporting local sustainable
        agriculture.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        CSA helps people reconnect with the food we eat, the land in which it is
        grown, and the people who grow it, a genuine opportunity to get in touch
        with where your food comes from. Other benefits include an abundance of local, seasonal,
        fresh farm products which means better tasting more nutritious food for
        members; and the farmers benefit from pre-sold crops easing the burden of
        in-season marketing while guaranteeing sales, along with increased cash
        flow upfront to meet start-up costs heading into a new season, and an opportunity
        for farmers to get to know the people their hard work is feeding. CSA is
        most often associated with small farms employing sustainable farming
        practices.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Implicit in this exchange is the shared element of risk and reward. Having
        formed a partnership for the season CSA members and farmers are in it
        together for whatever the season has in store. Most of what is experienced
        is an abundance of good food as the miraculous transformation from seed to
        vegetable never ceases to amaze. But working so closely with the
        unpredictability of nature each season also holds its share of setbacks.
        Members join the farmers in facing these setbacks. Pests, disease, and
        weather all pose challenges that can affect changes in the shares as
        planned. Changes in quality, quantity, and the timing and duration of a
        crops presence in the share can all be affected to varying degrees. As a
        matter of course occasionally crops do fail, fortunately the nature of CSA
        farming is to have a tremendous diversity of crops planted in many
        successions. So while you may miss a crop if it doesn't make it into your
        share, you will not be without an abundance of food.

        No one individual or governing body presides over the answer to the
        question, “What is CSA?” We shared with you a little about what CSA means
        to us, and pointed you to a couple of sources that do a good job of
        sussing out some of the more important ideas behind CSA. Hopefully this
        information will inspire you to ask questions of yourself: <b><i>What does CSA
        mean to me?</i></b>  How do <b><i>I</i></b> define local? Does this farm fit with that idea? How
        important is it that the farm be certified organic? If it is not certified
        can I trust the farmer's growing practices? How important is it that the
        farmer running the CSA grew the food I will be eating? If it is not grown
        at the CSA farm then grown where, by who and what practices were used? Can
        I meet the other farmers and see the other farms? What is in the CSA
        shares? How is food distributed? where do I pick it up? Are the farmers
        accessible? Can I visit the farm? Where is the farm located?
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Like any situation in which you consider joining a community or choose to
        invest in something financially it is important to get in touch with what is
        important to you, to so you can make informed
        decisions. Looking for the right farm to be your CSA farm is no different.
        We encourage you to research ours and other CSAs to find out what is out there,
        <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/csa/questions-for-csa.jsp" target="_blank">ask the right questions</a>,
        and find a good farm fit.
      </p>
</div>  
    <h3><a href="#how">How does our CSA work?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        Our CSA begins in April and runs through the third week of December. While
        we strongly encourage you to sign up in the winter preceding the the
        season, you can also join at any point after the season gets underway.
        Once you become a member our expectation is that you stay on for the
        season. If you wish to stop participating before the season is over please
        help us find someone to take over your membership. In the off season we
        also offer Winter Shares. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The shares are picked up each week by you at the GRUB CSA Farm
        <a href="#where" class="unhide">located</a>
        just 1½ miles from the heart of downtown Chico.
        We think you'll enjoy picking up your share at the farm. Take the
        opportunity to talk to your farmers, share recipe ideas or gardening tips,
        walk the fields where your food is grown, pick cherry tomatoes with your
        kids, and connect with others who value these things.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        The majority of share items are harvested the same day you pick them up,
        with the exception of storage crops such as garlic, onions, and winter
        squash, and when heat waves require us to harvest some share items the
        evening before. Once harvested  the crops are field washed and cooled, and
        just before you arrive, set out for you on tables in the shade of a
        magnificent English Walnut Tree at our farm. Then you arrive with a box,
        bag, or basket to gather your share during your chosen pick-up window,
        either Tuesdays or Thursdays between 4-6 PM (you choose one* when filling
        out our <a href="/misc/2013_app.pdf">CSA membership form</a>).
        Slate and chalk instruct you in how much of
        each item to take as you move down the tables laden with the vegetables
        that make up your share for the week. While we determine the <i>what</i> and <i>how
        much</i> of your share items, you make the final selections. Perhaps choosing
        only the smallest zucchinis because your family likes them the best, or
        selecting same-sized potatoes as you weigh them out so they cook off at
        the same time. <b>Our alternative to a pre-boxed share</b>
        gives you more choice, and fosters a sense of community, creating an
        environment where people feel welcome to hang-out and chat while children
        bounce on the trampoline or hang out with the chickens.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        *we are currently suggesting new members sign up for Tuesdays to help
        balance out the harvest, but we can still accommodate Thursdays if need
        be.
      </p>
</div>    
    <h3><a href="#contents">What is in a CSA share?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        Everything in our shares is grown by us truly. Each week a wide variety of
        vegetables make up the bulk of your share. We also provide culinary herbs
        on occasion, and in the spring we include snap dragons and garden starts
        from our greenhouse to round out the shares. As a member your share will
        consist of 7-12 items each week. Over the course of the season we hope to
        introduce you to varieties of vegetables you have never tried before. We
        run variety trials each season to continually update and improve what we
        offer. We especially value heirloom varieties and varieties adapted to our
        growing conditions. By providing you with new and unusual vegetable varieties,
        we hope to inspire creativity and experimentation in your kitchen. To
        see examples of what is in a CSA share at different points in the season
        see our
        <a href="#" class="sample_share_open" title="sample CSA Shares">sample shares</a>, or to get an idea of
        what vegetables we are growing and when we hope to harvest them for you
        see our
        <a href="#" class="csa_schedule_open" title="Projected CSA Harvest Schedule">projected CSA harvest schedule</a>.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Sometimes we experience an over abundance of some crops at certain points
        during the season, or harvest some vegetables that have minor damage that
        makes them unmarketable. In addition to donating these surplus vegetables
        to charity, we like to put them out for CSA members to take as optional
        items in addition to what is offered in the regular share. Sometimes these
        surplus veggies are available in larger quantities for preserving.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In the past for limited runs we have been able to offer pastured eggs,
        pastured pork, pastured chicken, fresh squeezed juice, and fresh fruit as
        extras not included in the price of your share. We hope to be able to
        offer these farm extras to you again at some point in the season.
      </p>
</div>  
    <h3><a href="#size">How big is a share?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        The size of the share will increase with the bounty of the season.
        Starting smaller early in the season, growing as the season progresses,
        and tapering off a bit towards the end; but generally if you cook at home
        often, one share should meet most of the seasonal vegetable needs
        for two to three adults
        or a family of four for the majority of the season. Some members find it beneficial to split a share,
        usually with a friend, neighbor, relative, or co-worker. There are many different
        ways to go about sharing a share with more than one household, contact us
        for ideas, or if you are having trouble finding a share partner.
      </p>
</div>    
    <h3><a href="#cost">How much does a CSA share cost? How do I pay?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        The cost for a CSA share is $84 per month, due at the first weekly pick-up
        of each month. There is also a once per season $100 annual membership fee
        due with your first payment upon joining. Make checks payable to: GRUB CSA
        Farm. Bring your payment with you to CSA pick-up or send it to: GRUB CSA
        Farm; 3197 West Sacramento Ave, Chico, Ca 95928. We also accept cash. Please do not
        send cash in the mail. When paying in cash please put your payment in an
        envelope clearly labeled with your name on it and the month(s) you are
        paying for.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        An annual membership fee paid in January, February, or March before the
        season begins reserves your place in the CSA and allows us to invest in
        farm infrastructure and make capital improvements for the upcoming season.
        Early payment also provides us with cash flow at a time when operating
        costs are high (purchasing seeds and updating inventories) and income is
        low. If you join the CSA after the season is underway your membership fee
        helps us meet operating costs as the season progresses. 
      </p>
  
      <p>
        With the cash flow generated by the annual membership fees received in the
        winter months we are better able to meet our start-up costs without having
        to charge members for a larger portion of the season up front to do so.
        These early annual membership fee payments are what allow us to offer our
        more affordable monthly payment schedule, helping us meet our goal of
        making fresh, healthy, sustainably grown produce more accessible to the
        greater Chico community. <i><b>If you are interested in paying for a larger
        portion of the season up front to help make our shares more accessible to
        others and to keep the farm running smoothly, please let us know.</b></i>
      </p>
</div>  
    <h3><a href="#seasonality">A note on seasonality.</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        One of the things many CSA members enjoy about receiving a share is the
        ease and joy of eating seasonally. If you are eating a fruit or vegetable
        that is out of season locally, then it has to be shipped by truck or
        plane; often picked long before fully ripe, the result is a meal featuring
        ingredients with inferior freshness, flavor, and nutrients. As a CSA
        member you will have an abundance of fresh seasonal produce provided for
        you each week, taking the guesswork out of eating seasonally, and
        providing your family with food that tastes better, is better for you, and
        is better for the planet. Eating seasonally helps us feel more connected
        to the rhythms of the seasons and more grounded in the place we call home.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        Here in the northern reaches of the Sacramento Valley we usually
        experience a dry spell in January long enough to work up some ground to
        accommodate the first plantings of the new season. Because of Winter's
        short daylight hours these crops come along slowly and won't begin coming
        to fruition until April. These crops will make up the bulk of your Spring
        CSA shares along with a handful of overwintered crops like onions,
        garlic, leeks, spinach and snap dragons. As Spring turns to Summer some
        vegetables are phased out, unable to be grown in the summer heat, and
        still others will come into season to take their place. As more vegetables
        come into season you will see an increase in the overall share size and
        the number of items that make up your shares, as well as more variety in
        the vegetables you see from week to week. By the time late Summer turns to
        early Fall we will be at the peak production of the season. Then as as
        daylight wanes and temperatures cool Summer crops begin to fade and some
        crops we haven't seen since Spring reappear while other Fall crops also
        make their way into the share. For an idea of what vegetables we have
        planned for your shares this season and when we hope to harvest them see
        our <a href="#" class="csa_schedule_open">projected CSA harvest schedule</a>. 
      </p>
</div>  
    <h3><a href="#late">Late pick-ups.</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        If you will not be able to pick up your share during your pick-up window
        please <a href="#contact">contact us</a> and let us know. We will
        box it up and leave it out for you to pick up at your convenience within
        24 hours. The sooner you pick it up the fresher it will be. 
      </p>
</div>  
    <h3><a href="#unable">Unable to pick-up.</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        Because we have to seed and plant crops months in advance to have them
        ready for you each week, we are not able to accommodate weeks off during
        the season. If for any reason you are unable
        to pick up your share please arrange for someone else to pick it up. Some
        of the best smiles we see are on the faces of the lucky ones gifted a
        share of veggies for a week. If no one will pick it up
        <a href="#contact">let us know</a> and we will donate your share.
      </p>
</div>
    <h3><a href="#where">Where is the GRUB CSA Farm located? Where do I pick-up my share?</a></h3><div>
      <p>
        We are located at 3197 West Sacramento Ave just 1.5 miles from downtown Chico. From
        the Downtown area head  west on W 8th St. Turn left at the stop sign onto
        Walnut Ave. Stay in the right lane and in less than ½ mile Walnut turns
        into Dayton Rd and you will see Maisie Jane's gift shop on your right,
        take the next left onto McIntosh Ave (if you get to the driveway at 1525
        Dayton Rd you just missed your turn, please turn around and enter the
        property from McIntosh Ave). Once on McIntosh turn right into the gravel
        driveway immediately after the dirt parking lot for the strawberry stand.
        Please park on the side of the driveway as you approach the larger trees.
        Walk straight ahead (without following the road as it curves to the right)
        until you find the tables in the shade of the enormous walnut tree on the
        east side of the buildings. Welcome! You have just arrived at the CSA
        Pick-up site.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In addition to the four acres of row crops we have in production at the
        GRUB CSA Farm, we also grow
        at the Riparia Farm on Estes Road on 1½ acres nestled amongst the riparian
        habitat of Comanche Creek located about ½ mile as the crow flies from our
        main farm site.
