    Our goal is to help educate our community on all the wonderful food we have growing around us and what to do with it. We teach where food comes from and how we can grow our own. We prefer to teach with hands-on activities, hopefully in a garden and with real food. We work with preschool children, school age children and adults.
  </p>
  <p>
    When working with children in the garden we teach about planting, weeding, harvesting, learning about soil, bugs, the seasons, understanding the difference between food grown in your garden and food grown elsewhere and anything else the children want to learn about. We often have a plan but also make sure our lessons are child-driven.
  </p>

    Through the program we have seen children learn they can grow their own food year-round in Chico. We have seen children try new foods straight from the garden and really enjoy it. Next time you are in a winter garden, pick a stalk of spinach and eat it right there. It is sweet, has a crunch, and most likely will be completely eaten by the child. We have found that children do not want the processed food, they want the whole, fresh food in its natural form.

    We are looking for funding to continue these programs. We have been involved in a number of different projects:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We have helped to start <b>preschool gardens</b>. This includes building raised beds, bringing in compost, and planting plants. We try to have the children be as involed with the procuss as possible. This not only teaches them the details of growing food, but also gives them some ownership over the work which can provide for a better flow through until harvest.
    </li>
    <li>
      Drop in <b>classroom visits</b> to all ages, provide one time lesson on farming. We can come talk to a group of children about food, growing food, eating food, how food grows, where food comes from, and just about anything else related to food.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Cooking classes</b> with adults and children. We can provide a cooking class that will highlight cooking with local food.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Farm tours</b> of Heartseed farm. These tours are created to meet the needs of your group. They may just be walking around the farm and seeing all the different projects we have going on, fruit trees, vegetables, animals, and all our other experiments. They may include doing some work, planting, weeding, harvesting. They may included cooking, imagining what a seed will grow into, studying the soil and seeing what kinds of bugs live in it. We customize the experience to the group.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Community workshops</b>. These include workshops that relate to farming, animal husbandry, water management, and other things we find cool to learn about. You can find out about upcoming events by checking our home page or checking <a href="http://cultivatingcommunitynv.org">culitivatingcommunitynv.org</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Farm workdays</b>. The heartseed farm has volunteer days Wednesday through Friday from 8:30am to 1pm. It is a great way to learn about growing food, connecting with others, and enjoying putting your hands in fresh soil. Just come on out down the McInotsh driveway and find the crew in the field.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We have received funding from local donors, the Annie Bâ€™s drive, mini grants, and larger state grants. We do our best to find large funding sources to cover ongoing expenses, but count on the local community to help fund the other elements to our program. Visit our <a href="/donate">Donate page</a> to learn how to make a donation.
